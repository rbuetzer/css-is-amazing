## Abusing the `:checked` selector

The [`:checked`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked)
selector is often used to show and hide content in forms based on the state of a
checkbox or radio button, like in the following example.

<CheckedStateCodeSample />

### Let's get moving with the `:checked` selector

Conditionally showing content is a nice application of the `:checked` selector,
but we can do a lot more. The following example shows how we can position a
container based on which radio button is checked.

To spice things up, we can animate the container.

What's more, we are not limited to styling the blue box. Instead we can style
the form elements themselves using the `:checked` pseudoclass. In the following
example, we can simulate increment/decrement buttons by cleverly positioning the
input elements.

### Decoupling

Styling elements depending on the checked state of input elements is nice, but
the code can get messy quite quickly, if you try to do more complex stuff.
Building an interactive 3d maze for example. Luckily, CSS enables us to decouple
the input element rules from the styles of the target element, by providing us
custom properties.

Custom properties can for example be used to hold properties of the template
like font sizes or colors. Often, they are set at the root level, however we are
free to define them in any rule we like.

In the following example, we have rules to set the property `--value` depending
on the checked state of the input elements. In nested components, we can then
read `value` to customize margins, paddings, sizes, colors, shadows and much
more.

### Debugging

There is one thing that we can do with custom property values, which is
especially noteworthy: We can print its value. For this, we abuse counters.
